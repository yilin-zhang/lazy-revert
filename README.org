#+title: Lazy Revert

* Introduction
Lazy Revert is a very simple package that provides an alternative auto-revert
solution extracted from [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]].

It only reverts visible buffers when the user:
a. saves a file
b. switches to a buffer (or its window)
c. focuses Emacs (after using another program)

Thank [[https://github.com/hlissner][@hlissner]] for the original implementation.

* Installation
An example of using =use-package= and =quelpa=:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package lazy-revert
  :ensure nil
  :quelpa (lazy-revert :fetcher github
                       :repo "yilin-zhang/lazy-revert")
  :hook (after-init . lazy-revert-mode)
  ;; Optional
  :config
  (setq auto-revert-verbose t ; let us know when it happens
        auto-revert-use-notify nil
        auto-revert-stop-on-user-input nil
        ;; Only prompts for confirmation when buffer is unsaved.
        revert-without-query (list ".")))
#+end_src

* Usage
Make sure you have =global-auto-revert-mode= and =auto-revert-mode= disabled,
then simply enable =lazy-revert-mode=, which is a global minor mode.
